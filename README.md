# BiFusion: Multimodal End-to-End Autonomous Driving via Bilateral Modality Interaction

This repository contains the official implementation of **BiFusion**, a novel multimodal end-to-end autonomous driving algorithm presented in our paper:  
**"Multimodal End-to-End Autonomous Driving via Bilateral Modality Interaction"**.  

BiFusion introduces a **bilateral modality interaction framework** to leverage the complementarity between RGB images and LiDAR point clouds, addressing the challenges of cross-modal data fusion in autonomous driving systems.
